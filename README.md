# python-spell-checker-mysql

This Python spell checker connects to a MySQL database for real-time word validation. It detects misspelled words, suggests corrections, and logs all changes with timestamps to track common errors and improve accuracy over time.

## Project Description

This interactive Python application functions as a robust spell checker by integrating with a MySQL dictionary database. Users can input sentences, and the system efficiently identifies misspelled or unrecognized words. For each detected error, it provides intelligent correction suggestions based on string similarity algorithms. Users have the flexibility to select from these suggestions, which are then logged with timestamps for future analysis, or to skip words entirely.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate practical applications of database integration, advanced string matching algorithms, and user-friendly interface design within Python. By logging user-chosen corrections with timestamps, the application generates valuable data for identifying common spelling errors and iteratively enhancing the accuracy of its suggestion engine. It serves as both a functional utility and a comprehensive learning platform for developing database-driven applications.

## Skills Learned

Throughout the development of this project, I gained hands-on experience and strengthened my skills in:

* **Database Management:** Connecting to and interacting with MySQL databases (CRUD operations, schema design for dictionary and logs).
* **Python Programming:** Developing interactive command-line applications, handling user input, and managing program flow.
* **String Manipulation:** Effectively processing and cleaning text, including handling punctuation and case sensitivity.
* **Algorithm Implementation:** Utilizing and understanding string similarity algorithms (e.g., `difflib.get_close_matches`) for intelligent suggestions.
* **Error Handling & Logging:** Implementing mechanisms to identify and suggest corrections for misspelled words, and logging changes for analytical purposes.
* **Data Analysis Fundamentals:** Understanding how logged data can be used to track patterns and improve system performance over time.
